This includes area spells, which only the target attempts a saving throw against. Any ongoing effects of the area, such as the difficult terrain from scatter scree, affect only the target’s space. Some feats let you affect more creatures.<br><br>Reach: The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, gouging claw would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and frostbite would affect only a creature in your weapon’s reach, even though the spell’s range is longer.<br><br>Ancillary Effects: Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, scatter scree would still create difficult terrain in the target’s space (as mentioned above) and tangle vine’s circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.<br><br>Multiple Defenses: Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones.<br><br>Invalid or Immune Target: If the target you hit wouldn’t be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn’t affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.<br><br>Variable Actions: Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can’t use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.<br><br>Spellshape: You typically can’t use spellshape with Spellstrike because spellshape actions require the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn’t qualify.","traits":"3rd Party","src":"SSS","databaseID":1},{"name":"Perfect Blade","id":"fd8faf5e-1331-40d2-9585-e4fba00fa446","description":"You wield your blade with a magical focus, combining your stance and blade techniques with the arcane and martial might of magus techniques.<br><br>When you use Lightning Draw, you can spend an additional action to Spellstrike with your chosen weapon instead of making a normal Strike.

You gain a 1st-or-2nd-level wizard exploit feat or spellshape feat of your choice. Additionally, when utilizing exploits, you can expend an arcanist spell slot or a focus point instead of a prepared spell slot; when you do so, you are counted as expending a prepared version of any spell in your spell collection of your choice. If you expend a focus point, you are counted as expending a spell slot whose rank is equal to half your level, rounded up.<br><br><i>Pathbuilder Note: Add the chosen exploit or spellshape feat as a bonus feat</i>","traits":"3rd Party","src":"SSS","databaseID":1},{"name":"Arcanist Spellcasting Adjustments","id":"a23b15da-80b9-4760-bd66-14876dbec6fc","description":"You learn spells as normal for a wizard, but change your spellcasting from your class as follows.<br> - You can cast fewer spells each day. Your number of spell slots per day don't advance from 2 to 3 spells at even levels.<br> - During your daily preparations, you prepare a spell collection rather than preparing spells into each spell slot individually. The number of spells in your spell collection each day equals your level + 1. As normal, you select these spells from your spellbook.<br> - You can cast any of the spells in your collection by using a spell slot of an appropriate level. For instance, if you were level 1 and had <i>gentle landing</i> and <i>force barrage</i> in your spell collection, you could cast <i>gentle landing</i> twice that day, <i>force barrage</i> twice, or each spell once.<br><br><b>Heightening Spells</b><br>Once you gain 2nd-level spells, you can heighten any spell in your spell collection to any level you can cast, similar to a spontaneous spellcaster's signature spells. The only restriction is that you must select at least one 1st-level spell for your collection each time you prepare, ensuring that you can use all your spell slots each day.<br><br><b>Adjudicating Class Feats and Features</b><br>Some of your class feats or features might rely on the fact that you prepare spells in spell slots. While some class feats might no longer work or be necessary with the arcanist archetype, in many cases you can make a simple replacement and continue using the class feat. The many class feats simply require replacing “a spell you have prepared” or “a prepared spell” for “a spell in your collection” or “a spell slot.” For example, in Counterspell, you'd replace “a spell you have prepared” in the trigger for “a spell in your collection” and “expend a prepared spell” for “expend a spell slot.” Similarly, in arcane bond, you'd replace “cast one spell you prepared today and already cast” with “cast one spell in your collection you've already cast today.”","traits":"3rd Party","src":"SSS","databaseID":1},{"name":"Reflex Expertise","id":"e4eecb2b-12c7-46c4-bd1a-62b6ace63969","description":"You've developed a knack for dodging danger.
