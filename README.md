Pathbuilder Files for all of OfflineEnigma's/Michael Hosp's/My supplements. Just download the json files and import them, and have fun!

Known Issues
- 
* Player Core 2 subclass abilities are not in yet. They will be added as soon as Pathbuilder updates to add them.
* Several class features (notably domain spells) cannot be selected; they, similarly, cannot be accessed in custom specials. Similar update hopes await.
* Mythic Lichdom is not currently implemented due to Mythic customization being unavailable.

**Add other problems WITH THE PATHBUILDER FILES as issues to this Github.**
Issues with the book should be directed to enigmahomebrew@gmail.com
